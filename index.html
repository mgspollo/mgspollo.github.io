                                    <li><h3>Main project - Imaging and reconstructing proteins</h3>
                                <p>As discussed in the summary, I was trying to image proteins to reconstruct a model of the protein and in future find a way to identify the dynamics of the protein. I repeatedly imaged some standard proteins (apoferritin, ferritin and beta-galactosidase) in different conditions. I took hundreds of videos (and terabytes of data) but never got any <i>good</i> data on this. <br><br> In the end, I concluded that this project was physically impossible with the equipment I had available, and may never be possible. This conclusion was supported by a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.5125">publication this year</a>.</p>
                                </li>

                                <h3>Imaging Amyloid-beta </h3>
                                <p>Amyloid-beta is a small peptide (basically a tiny protein) which stick together to form larger structure including fibres and plaques. This process is associated with Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms behind this aren't completely clear, so we aimed to image the process to give some insights (along with how we could stop it happening with drugs!). </p>

                                <p>I had some success here. In particular, I saw examples of the amyloid-beta forming phase-separated droplet, this property was not known about at the time, but was published by others at a similar time.

                                <p>My data was largely images and videos, which required pretty painstaking manual analysis with an app called ImageJ (FIJI). I quickly decided I needed to automate some processing because it was taking too much time (often this kind of work is divided between experimental and computational students). I used Python to automate processing and ended up creating a library of useful methods. <br><br>

                                I wanted to make this as simple as possible to use, so I developed an app, so it was available to non-coding users. </p>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/SimpliPyTEM-image.png" /></span>

                                <p>I also made the code as straight-forward to use as possible, while also including powerful options, including using a pre-trained AI to de-noise the image.

                                <p>Theres a concept in electron microscopy called the contrast transfer function (CTF). This is a mathematical function which models how images are degraded due to imperfections in lenses. I wanted to better understand how microscope parameters affect this degradation so I built an interactive plot so the result of changing the variables could be visualised.

I used some basic image processing in Python to create a figure to generate this (full walkthrough <a href="https://github.com/gabriel-ing/EM_calculations/blob/main/Statistically_noisy_averaged_picture.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a>).

								<h2 class="major">PhD Summary</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/MeWithMicroscope.jpeg" alt="Me with the electron microscope" /><p>Me with the electron microscope</p></span>
								<p>The main aim of my PhD was to use electron microscopy to image proteins in liquids. Don't worry if you don't understand this sentence, let me explain it bit by bit!</p>
                                <h5>Electron Microscopy</h5>
                                <p>An electron microscope is essentially a very big microscope which can look at very small things. A conventional light microscope is limited in resolution (i.e. how small it can see) due to the wavelength of light. This limit is generally a few micrometres (10<sup>-6</sup>mm). Electrons can be used instead of light, meaning this limit can be reduced to tenths or even hundredths of nanometers (10<sup>-10</sup>-10<sup>-11</sup>m). This detail is needed for my samples of interest!
                                </p>
                                <h5>Proteins</h5>
                                <p>Proteins are one of the most important biological macromolecules. Proteins are the main molecules that break things, make things and do things in the cells. Most drugs work by interacting with proteins making them a key area of biological research. Proteins live in liquids (in cells) and often use flexibility and dynamic movements to do their functions.</p>
                                <h5>Electron Microscopy in Liquids</h5>
                                <p>Generally solid samples are used for electron microscopy because the microscope needs to be a vacuum, and liquids aren't very stable in vacuums!
                                <br><br>
                                The main method to image proteins in an electron microscope is to freeze them in a very thin layer of ice. To understand the structure of the protein, millions of particles are imaged and the images projected into a 3D model. Advanced methods can even work out how the particles move based on the different positions represented in the images of particles. This is like trying to work out how a fish swims by freezing a barrel of fish and looking at the positions of the fish!
                                <br><br>
                                Technological developments mean we can now image liquids in an electron microscope by holding it in thin but strong membranes. The aim of my PhD was to use these systems to take videos of proteins so we could <i>watch</i> the protein dynamics directly - like taking a video of a fish swimming.
                                </p>
                                <h5>
                                    The Issues
                                </h5>
                                <p>Unfortunately, like all things in science, it was not that simple. The problems were broken down into three main issues:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Low contrast </strong> - The proteins are lightweight and small so are almost invisible in our systems.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Movement</strong> - The proteins move faster than we can image, meaning motion blurring was an issue</li>
                                        <li><strong>Damage</strong> - Electron beams are high energy radiation which can break bonds and destroy the molecules. Our samples might have been falling apart before they could be seen.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>

                                <h2 class="major">Project San Marino</h2>
                                <p>For more info, this project is available on <a href="https://github.com/gabriel-ing/ProjectSanMarino" target="_blank">github</a></p>
                                <p>My partner and I wanted to create a virtual exercise challenge, a bit like the <a href="https://www.theconqueror.events/" target="_blank">conquerer challenges</a> but without the cost. The idea was that we would track the distance we walked, ran or cycled, aiming to cover a set distance over a couple of months.  We decided to go from our home in Edinburgh to San Marino because it sounded like the right distance for our time frame (2-3 months) and expected exercise amounts. This article will go through how I approached tracking the challenge.
                                </p><h5>Question 1: How should I track the challenge?</h5>
                                <p>As with most runners and cyclists, we are used to tracking our exercise routes on the online exercise social media app <a href="https://www.strava.com/" target="_blank" >Strava</a>.<br><br> My first plan of attack was to take screenshots of the data, upload it to a google drive, and using an image-reading tool to extract the data from a screenshot. However, after running into some issues with that I realised there was a much easier way: usings Strava's data-downloading APIs. <br><br> Its possible to download all your exercise data directly from Strava. Now this is quite annoying to set up and had me tearing my hair out for a couple of hours but I eventually figured it out. I'm not going to described the full process here because I followed tutorials made by <a href="https://medium.com/@lejczak.learn/get-your-strava-activity-data-using-python-2023-%EF%B8%8F-b03b176965d0">Ksawery Lejczak</a>, <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/using-the-strava-api-and-pandas-to-explore-your-activity-data-d94901d9bfde">Matt Ambrogi</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgscChKfGyg&t=258s&ab_channel=franchyze923">franchyze923</a>. I recommend starting with these if you want to use the Strava API. The result of this is a massive table with <i>loads</i> of info.</p>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/Strava_data2.png"/><p>A small sample of the downloadable data table</p></span>
                                <h5>Question 2: How can I create the route?</h5>
                                <p>This was answered fairly simply. I wanted to create a .kmz file which is used to store map details. It turns out you can create custom maps on google's <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/" target="_blank">My Maps</a> and then export coordinates as a .kmz file. I created my route using googles mapping tools.</p>
                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/Create_directions.png"/><p>My Maps mapping tools</p></span>
                                <h5>Question 3: How should I plot the route and my position on a map?</h5>
                                <p>
                                    I'm a Python native. Its the first coding language I learned, its by far my most used, it can do everything(ish), so there was never much of a question, I was always going to use Python. I used several different geographic libraries to create the route and calculate my position on the route. I'm not going to go into every detail of data processing, but I used Folium to create nice looking maps. This library made it easy to plot the route as well as adding our current position to the route as pop-ups. Below is the final example of this.
                                </p>
                                <div id="map-container" class="iframe-container">
                                    <iframe src="Project_san_marino_map.html" title="Folium Map"></iframe>
                                </div>
                                <h5>Question 4 - How best to track the challenge?</h5>
                                <p>Now I had all the data I had think about what information I wanted to output and how to do it. I decided to create an webpage-based (html) dashboard with the main map, some plots and some updated information. The main plots I wanted was a comparison of distance done by me and my partner, a tracking worm showing the distance over time (alongside the target rate) and maps of the route, and all the routes that we walked/ran/cycled. This was a static webpage that was created by running the script. Not the most-convenient or advanced way of doing this, but it certainly did the job!
                                </p>
                                <span class="image main"><a href="sanmarino/dash.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/Example_dash.png"/></a> <p>The dashboard. For the final state click the image!</p></span>
                                <h5>Question 5 - How did the challenge go?</h5>
                                <p>We completed it! 2200km in just under 2 months. We barely believed we would manage it, but we actually smashed past our most optimistic goal. Below is a picture of me after we finished the race on a french beach.</p>

                                <p>I wanted to learn how to use D3.js to create stunning interactive visuals, as well as wanting a convenient way of looking at running data, like distance run per week and the pace of the run. D3.js is a JavaScript library used to create <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery?utm_source=d3js-org&utm_medium=hero&utm_campaign=try-observable">amazing visuals</a>. It is super customisable, but the trade off being that it requires a lot of manual work.<br><br>At the same time I wanted to learn to create dynamic websites using a Python backend with Flask. As github pages (which hosts this site) can only be used for static websites, I can't show the data being downloaded and plotted all together, so the plot below won't be updated automatically, but I have used Flask to link the dashboard directly to the Strava API.
